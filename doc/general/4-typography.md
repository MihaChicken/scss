# Typography

One of the most important techniques for effectively communicating (or “honoring”) content is the use of typographic hierarchy. Typographic hierarchy is a system for organizing type that establishes an order of importance within the data, allowing the reader to easily find what they are looking for and navigate the content.

Fabric uses **Acumin Pro** with a base size of **16px** for **1rem**. It is a strong but neutral typeface that lends personality to the page without overpowering the content.

Typographic hierarchy is created by:
- - Size
- - Weight
- - Color
- - Position
- - Contrast

Most commonly these methods are used in combination with each other. Fabric uses the color **“fiord”** for its titles and labels to arise a slight differentiation from other values.
